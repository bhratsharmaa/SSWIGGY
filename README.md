Despite this, Indian cuisine remains one of the most sought-after culinary choices in the area, indicating a strong demand.

This pricing range aligns well with customer preferences, making it an attractive proposition for potential restaurant owners.

### Meeting Customer Needs

Given the popularity of Indian cuisine, it is prudent to include it in the restaurant's menu offerings.
