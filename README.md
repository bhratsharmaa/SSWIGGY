# Aim:

The project's primary goal was to analyze Swiggy's data in Bangalore thoroughly and extract valuable insights. The resulting insights aim to act as a strategic compass for individuals aspiring to establish a cloud kitchen in Bangalore, offering a nuanced understanding of the city's culinary preferences and market dynamics.

# Project Description:

Our project embarked on a data-driven journey to unlock the secrets of Bangalore's culinary landscape. Leveraging Selenium, we meticulously extracted a wealth of data from Swiggy, the city's foremost food delivery platform. This raw data was then skillfully processed and loaded into Excel for in-depth analysis. Utilizing the power of data visualization, we crafted insightful charts and graphs that illuminated trends, customer preferences, and peak ordering hours.

These visualizations served as our compass, guiding us toward providing actionable recommendations for aspiring entrepreneurs seeking to establish a successful cloud kitchen in Bangalore. Our project stands as a testament to the potential of data in gastronomic entrepreneurship, offering strategic insights derived from the rich tapestry of Bangalore's food culture.
